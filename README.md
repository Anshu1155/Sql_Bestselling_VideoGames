# Sql_Bestselling_VideoGames
The database for this Project is obtained from "Kaggle".
Purpose
This data was created to try to answer the question "are video games getting worse?" 
There is a lot of talk about video games getting worse every year due to companies trying to maximize profits,
instead making quality games so I wanted to explore that idea.
-Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence.

## In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020.
## We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.
